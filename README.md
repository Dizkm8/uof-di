# .NET Core Web API - Unit of Work and Generic Repository Implementation

This .NET Core Web API project serves as an initial implementation of the UnitOfWork pattern and GenericRepository while emphasizing Dependency Injection (DI) and a degree of decoupling. The project is inspired by the information provided in the following link: [Implementing the Repository and Unit of Work Patterns in an ASP.NET MVC Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)

Please note that this is an initial version, and it is planned to enhance the GenericRepository to support asynchronous operations in the near future.

## Overview

The implementation of the UnitOfWork pattern and GenericRepository in this Web API project aims to achieve the following goals:

Separation of Concerns: The code is organized to separate the concerns of data access, business logic, and API endpoints, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code.

Dependency Injection (DI): The project heavily relies on DI to inject dependencies, making it more testable and modular.

Decoupling: Efforts have been made to reduce tight coupling between components to improve code maintainability and flexibility.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- Controllers: Contains API controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Data: In order to simplify development on this I used in memory database, but it can be easily changed to use SQL Server or any other database. If you want to use in production environment or even a serious development, you should use a database.
- Context: Includes the DbContext class responsible for database interactions.
  Repositories: Contains the GenericRepository class responsible for data operations.
- Models: Includes data models used by the API.
- Services: Contains business logic and services that interact with repositories.
- Program.cs: Configures DI and sets up the application's middleware.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the solution in your preferred development environment.

3. run the command `dotnet restore` to restore the project's dependencies.

4. run the command `dotnet run` to run the project.

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/api/words` to view the list of words.

## Future Enhancements

This initial version of the project is planned for further enhancements:

- Async Support: The GenericRepository will be updated to include asynchronous methods for better performance and responsiveness.

- Improved Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms will be added for more informative error messages.

- Logging: Implement a logging mechanism to track application activities and troubleshoot issues.
